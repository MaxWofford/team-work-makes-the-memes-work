## Actions

### Copy a file for later

Right click the image, gif, video, or whatever the cool kids are using these days. Click "Rememeber link". An input box will show up on the page. Type in comma delimited tags

### Paste a tagged link

Right click anywhere on the page and scroll to "Random gif" in the context menu. A list of your tags will show up. Click the tag you want to use and the extension will save the link to a random file with that tag into your clipboard.

### Search for a link to paste

Click the Chrome extension, then start typing a tag name (it will autofocus on an input box in the extension's popup window). Images that match the search tag will begin showing up in the extension's popup window. Click on one to copy the link. Need another of the same search? Just click the extension again -- your previous search will stay in the input box.
